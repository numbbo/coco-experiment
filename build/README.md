# COCO bindings

This folder contains the language bindings for the COCO framework.
Each binding is meant to be built with the language specific tool (e.g. `cargo` for Rust, `pip`/`build` for Python).
Before a binding can be built, the core sources need to be bundled using the `fabricate` script in the `scripts/` directory of the repository.
For details, please see the file `DEVELOPMENT.md` in the root of the repository.
