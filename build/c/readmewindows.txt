For Windows users, several options exist:

1) you install Cygwin and compile, build, and run Coco from there.

2) you use nmake and the corresponding NMakefile or

3) you want to run everything in the standard command shell (CMD).
   In the latter case, we suggest to 
	* install Anaconda
	* install MinGW (make sure to install a 32bit version, even on a 64 bit machine)
	* install gnu make (gnuwin32)
