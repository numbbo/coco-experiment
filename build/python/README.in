COCO/NumBBO framework $COCO_VERSION
===================================

Prerequisites
-------------

The simplest way to check the prerequisits is to go directly to "Installation"
below and give it a try. Then act upon failure, as in this case probably one of
the following is lacking: 

- Python is installed (version >=2.7). If this is not the case, check out
  Anaconda at [https://www.continuum.io], as this provides additionally all
  Python packages necessary to run the COCO postprocessing as well as the
  ipython shell.

- `make` is installed and works with one of the MakeFiles provided in folder
  `code-experiments/build/c`. The call to `make` will invoke a C compiler, which
  needs to be present as well. You might type `make` within the `build/c` folder
  to see whether this works. 


Installation
------------

In a system shell:

1) cd into the `numbbo` (framework root) folder. 

2) type, i.e. execute,

  python do.py run-python
  
which will build and (locally) install the cocoex Python module and (test-)run
the `example_experiment.py` file.^1

3) copy (and rename) `example_experiment.py` to a place (and name) of
your choice. Modify this file to include the solver of your choice (instead of
random_search) to the benchmarking framework.

4) execute the modified example_experiment.py file.^2 

See: [http://numbbo.github.io/index.html] TODO: check / specify

Details:
- The Python interface code, file `interface.c`, has been generated with Cython.
  Under normal circumstance this c-file is delivered with the library and does
  not need to be generated by the user.

^1, you will see something like the following:

numbbo$ python do.py run-python
AML	['code-experiments/src/coco_generics.c', 'code-experiments/src/coco_random.c', 'code-experiments/src/coco_suite.c', 'code-experiments/src/coco_observer.c', 'code-experiments/src/coco_runtime_c.c'] -> code-experiments/build/python/cython/coco.c
COPY	code-experiments/src/coco.h -> code-experiments/build/python/cython/coco.h
COPY	code-experiments/src/best_values_hyp.txt -> code-experiments/build/python/best_values_hyp.txt
COPY	code-experiments/src/bbob2009_testcases.txt -> code-experiments/build/python/bbob2009_testcases.txt
EXPAND	code-experiments/build/python/README.in to code-experiments/build/python/README
EXPAND	code-experiments/build/python/setup.py.in to code-experiments/build/python/setup.py
PYTHON	setup.py check --metadata --strict in code-experiments/build/python
PYTHON	setup.py install --home /var/folders/0_/q0twpqj16xv3khqtjp8l9c4c0000gn/T/cocoewfTbn in code-experiments/build/python
PYTHON	code-experiments/build/python/example_experiment.py in .

^2 using ipython (highly recommended, see prerequisites):

    >>> import example_experiment_or_new_name as ee
    >>> ee.main()
