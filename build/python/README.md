COCO/NumBBO Framework in Python (Experimental Part)
===================================================

Prerequisites
-------------

The simplest way to check the prerequisits is to go directly to [_Getting Started_](#Getting-Started)
below and give it a try. Then act upon failure, as in this case probably one of
the following is lacking: 

- Python is installed (version >=2.7). If this is not the case, check out
  [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io), as this provides additionally all
  Python packages necessary to run the COCO postprocessing as well as the
  ipython shell. The postprocessing needs currently Python 2.7. 

- `make` is installed and works with one of the MakeFiles provided in folder
  `code-experiments/build/c`. You might type `make` within the `build/c` folder
  to see whether this works. 
  
- A C compiler, like `gcc`, which is invoked by `make`. 


# Getting Started

Download the [COCO framework code](https://github.com/numbbo/numbbo) from github by clicking [here](https://github.com/numbbo/numbbo/archive/development.zip), 
**CAVEAT: this code is still under development**, and unzip the `zip` file. 

In a system shell:

0. cd into the `numbbo` (framework root) folder, where the file `do.py` lies. 

1. Type, i.e. execute,
  ```
    python do.py run-python
  ```  
  which will build, install (locally) and test the `cocoex` Python module, and run 
  `python code-experiments/build/python/example_experiment.py`.[^1] 

2. Copy (and rename) `example_experiment.py` to a place (and name) of
your choice. Modify this file to include the solver of your choice (instead of
`random_search`) to the benchmarking framework.

3. Execute the modified file either from a system shell like 
  ```
      python example_experiment_or_new_name.py
  ```
  or in python or ipython (highly recommended, see prerequisites) like
  ```
      ipython
      Python 2.7.11 ...
      >>> import example_experiment_or_new_name as ee
      >>> ee.main()
  ```

Details
-------
- The Python interface code, file `interface.c`, has been generated with Cython.
  Under normal circumstance this c-file is delivered with the library and does
  not need to be generated by the user.
