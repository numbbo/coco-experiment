  - `build/` contains the builds which can be used to run experiments. 
    See [here](https://github.com/numbbo/coco/blob/master/README.md) 
    and `do.py` in the root folder for how to build the code.  
  - `documentation/` doesn't contain anything really useful yet
  - `examples/` contains (more) examples, but see `build` first
  - `src/` contains the source code.
  - `test/` contains unit and integration tests.
