# COmparing Continuous Optimisers (COCO) experiments

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This repository contains the source files for the experiment part of the `coco` framework.
> If you don't want to *extend* the framework, you probably don't need this!
> See instead the [new documentation](https://numbbo.it/getting-started) and use the language bindings of your choice from the package repository for your language (e.g. PyPI for Python, crates.io for Rust, ...).
